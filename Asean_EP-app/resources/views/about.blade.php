    <div class="detail1">
      <p>Asean Entrepreneurship Profiling can be a reference for entrepreneurs to conduct self-assessment 
        so that they can get the right profile picture to become a successful entrepreneur. This profiling 
        is expected to contribute to increasing the success of entrepreneurs in particular so that they can 
        be useful in improving the nationâ€™s economy more broadly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="detail2">
      <p>The success of entrepreneurs in developing a business is determined by many things. These complex 
        factors automatically produce a comprehensive entrepreneur profile. On the other hand, the proliferation 
        of start-up businesses and various entrepreneurship models does not necessarily make all types of businesses 
        successful. Not to mention the occurrence of competition not only by local business actors of a country, 
        but also competition between countries. Therefore, ASEAN Entrepreneurship Profiling is one of the initial 
        efforts to reconcile profiles between ASEAN countries and also finds the strongest determinants of forming 
        entrepreneurs in ASEAN.</p>
